 🔥 Multi-Room Heat Balance (Conduction Only)

 📘 Project Description
This project analyzes steady-state heat conduction in a 4-floor building using thermal resistance network concepts.  
The heat balance equations are formulated in matrix form and solved using MATLAB to determine the temperature distribution across floors.

 🏢 Problem Statement
- 4-floor building (Ground, 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Heat transfer by conduction only
- Steady-state condition
- Heat generation in the top floor
- Constant ambient temperature

 🧮 Methodology
- Apply thermal resistance concept  
- Convert resistance to conductance (G = 1/R)  
- Formulate heat balance equations  
- Write system in matrix form: [A][T] = [B]
- Solve using MATLAB  

 ⚙️ Input Parameters
- R1 = 0.1  
- R2 = 0.48  
- Tamb = 35 °C  
- Qgen = 50 W  

 📊 Output
- Temperature at each floor  
- Temperature vs Floor graph  

 ✅ Conclusion
The matrix-based method efficiently predicts temperature distribution in multi-room conduction systems and can be extended to buildings with more floors.
